Asset Hunter

Are you trying to go below a certain buildsize?
Are all the old placeholder graphics and models cluttering up your project?
Didn't you ever get around to delete the auto generated materials after model import?
Do you have large amount of sounds in your project, but is only using a small number of them?
Does it seem like too large a task to remove obsolete assets?

If any of the above applies to you, Asset Hunter is the tool for you

Asset Hunter is a tool that analyzes your buildlog and gives you an easily understandable overview over unused asset in your project folder. The results are grouped into folders and file types, making it easy to start cleaning up your project.

Additionally it list the uncompressed size of all the assets used in the build, enabling you to better downsize your buildsize.

How to open the window:

2. Open the window
